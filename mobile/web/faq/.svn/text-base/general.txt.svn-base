Will sketches from Mobile Processing run on my mobile phone?
Sketches created using Mobile Processing will run on Java Powered mobile phones. These phones run a version of Java called Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME). Mobile Processing sketches are mobile applications, called MIDlets, that are currently compatible with the CLDC 1.0, MIDP 1.0 release of the J2ME platform.
