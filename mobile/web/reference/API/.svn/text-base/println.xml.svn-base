Writes to the text area of the Processing environment's console. This is often helpful for looking at the data a program is producing. Each call to this function creates a new line of output. Individual elements can be separated with quotes ("") and joined with the string concatenation operator (+). Also writes the content of an array to the text area of the Processing environment. This is often helpful for looking at the data a program is producing. A new line is put between each element of the array. This function can only print 1D arrays, but can test to see if the content are null or not null for 2+ dimensional arrays.
