The <b>multitap</b> function will turn on multitap text input. When enabled, each key press will be interpreted according to the multitap input method and stored in an array of characters called <b>multitapBuffer</b>.<br /><br />
The multitap input method interprets each key press based on the letters associated with the key as seen on a typical phone key pad. For example, the 2 key is associated with the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If the user presses the 2 key once, it is interpreted as the first letter associated with the key, which is 'a'. If the user presses the 2 key three times quickly, this will be interpreted as the letter 'c', which is the third letter associated with the key. A fourth press will be interpreted as the number 2, and subsequent presses will cycle through the same characters.<br /><br />
The <b>multitapBuffer</b> array contains the characters interpreted by the multitap input method. This array will automatically grow in size depending upon the number of characters entered. The variable <b>multitapBufferLength</b> represents the actual number of characters stored in the array.<br /><br />
The <b>multitapBufferIndex</b> variable represents the location of the editing "cursor" in the buffer. If the user presses the left or right directional keys, this cursor will be moved in the buffer.
