Writes to the console area of the Processing environment. This is often helpful for looking at the data a program is producing. The companion function <b>println()</b> works like <b>print()</b>, but creates a new line of text for each call to the function. Individual elements can be separated with quotes ("") and joined with the addition operator (+). Also writes the content of an array to the text area of the Processing environment's console. This is often helpful for looking at the data a program is producing. A space is put between each element of the array. This function can only print 1D arrays, but can test to see if the content are null or not null for 2+ dimensional arrays.
