		A Transcript from Processing Tech Support
		circa 2020<BR><BR>
		by <a href="http://www.coin-operated.com/projects" target="_new">Jonah Brucker-Cohen</a><BR><BR>

The year is <font size="1" color="#FFFF00" face="verdana"><b>2020</b></font>. The future of computing is a battle over two opposing forces: Free and Not-Free. After milking an International Tribunal for all it could in a joint settlement over WindowsX-Patriot (co-funded by the U.S. Dept of Homeland Security), Microsoft has bit the dust. It the giant's wake, has come a slew of new money grubbing pundits working for the man. The only force growing steadily enough to challenge this threat is Processing, a group of so-called technologists turned artists who have coolaborativly created the world's most advanced programming language. <BR><BR>
