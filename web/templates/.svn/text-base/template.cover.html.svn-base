    <div class="intro">
        <p>Processing is an open source programming language and environment for 
        people who want to create images, animations, and interactions. Initially 
        developed to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach fundamentals of 
        computer programming within a visual context, Processing also has evolved 
        into a tool for generating finished professional work. Today, there are tens 
        of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who 
        use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.

	<p><strong>Announcing Processing 1.5+</strong></p>
		
	<p>
		A lot has changed in the nine months since 1.2.1 was released, the biggest being the 
		introduction of "modes" for the editor, allowing you to switch between Android 
		development and the classic desktop/web mode. More modes are coming in future 
		releases. Please read <a ref="http://processing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/processing/build/shared/revisions.txt">revisions.txt</a>

		<p><strong>Announcing Processing.js 1.0!</strong></p>
		
		<p>Our sister project <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a> has released its 1.0 version. As they explain, "Processing.js makes your data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language, include it in your web page, and Processing.js does the rest. It's not magic, but almost." They wrote a <a href="http://processingjs.org/reference/articles/p5QuickStart">quick start guide</a> for you.</p>
