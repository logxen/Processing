<description><![CDATA[
Similar to <b>createInput()</b>, this creates a Java <b>OutputStream</b> for a given filename or path. The file will be created in the sketch folder, or in the same folder as an exported application.
<br /><br />
If the path does not exist, intermediate folders will be created. If an exception occurs, it will be printed to the console, and <b>null</b> will be returned.
<br /><br />
This function is a convenience over the Java approach that requires you to 1) create a FileOutputStream object, 2) determine the exact file location, and 3) handle exceptions. Exceptions are handled internally by the function, which is more appropriate for "sketch" projects.
<br /><br />
If the output filename ends with <b>.gz</b>, the output will be automatically GZIP compressed as it is written.
