<description><![CDATA[
Saves an image from the display window. Images are saved in TIFF, TARGA, JPEG, and PNG format depending on the extension within the <b>filename</b> parameter. For example, "image.tif" will have a TIFF image and "image.png" will save a PNG image. If no extension is included in the filename, the image will save in TIFF format and <b>.tif</b> will be added to the name. These files are saved to the sketch's folder, which may be opened by selecting "Show sketch folder" from the "Sketch" menu. It is not possible to use <b>save()</b> while running the program in a web browser.
<br/>
All images saved from the main drawing window will be opaque. To save images without a background, use <b>createGraphics()</b>.
