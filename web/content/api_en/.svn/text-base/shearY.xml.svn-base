<description><![CDATA[
Shears a shape around the y-axis the amount specified by the <b>angle</b> parameter. Angles should be specified in radians (values from 0 to PI*2) or converted to radians with the <b>radians()</b> function. Objects are always sheared around their relative position to the origin and positive numbers shear objects in a clockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling <b>shearY(PI/2)</b> and then <b>shearY(PI/2)</b> is the same as <b>shearY(PI)</b>. If <b>shearY()</b> is called within the <b>draw()</b>, the transformation is reset when the loop begins again.
<br/> <br/>
Technically, <b>shearY()</b> multiplies the current transformation matrix by a rotation matrix. This function can be further controlled by the <b>pushMatrix()</b> and <b>popMatrix()</b> functions.
