Datatype for storing shapes. Processing can currently load and display SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) shapes. Before a shape is used, it must be loaded with the <b>loadShape()</b> function. The <b>shape()</b> function is used to draw the shape to the display window. The <b>PShape</b> object contain a group of methods, linked below, that can operate on the shape data. 
<br /><br />
The <b>loadShape()</b> function supports SVG files created with Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator. It is not a full SVG implementation, but offers some straightforward support for handling vector data.
