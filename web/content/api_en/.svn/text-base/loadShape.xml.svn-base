<description><![CDATA[
Loads vector shapes into a variable of type <b>PShape</b>. Currently, only SVG files may be loaded. To load correctly, the file must be located in the data directory of the current sketch. In most cases, <b>loadShape()</b> should be used inside <b>setup()</b> because loading shapes inside <b>draw()</b> will reduce the speed of a sketch.<br/> 
<br/>
The <b>filename</b> parameter can also be a URL to a file found online. For security reasons, a Processing sketch found online can only download files from the same server from which it came. Getting around this restriction requires a <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/Sign_an_Applet">signed applet</a>.<br/> 
<br/>
If a shape is not loaded successfully, the <b>null</b> value is returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt the program, however the null value may cause a NullPointerException if your code does not check whether the value returned from <b>loadShape()</b> is null.
