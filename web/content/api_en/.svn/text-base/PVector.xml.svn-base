<description><![CDATA[
A class to describe a two or three dimensional vector. This datatype stores two or three variables that are commonly used as a position, velocity, and/or acceleration. Technically, <em>position</em> is a point and <em>velocity</em> and <em>acceleration</em> are vectors, but this is often simplified to consider all three as vectors. For example, if you consider a rectangle moving across the screen, at any given instant it has a position (the object's location, expressed as a point.), a velocity (the rate at which the object's position changes per time unit, expressed as a vector), and acceleration (the rate at which the object's velocity changes per time unit, expressed as a vector). Since vectors represent groupings of values, we cannot simply use traditional addition/multiplication/etc. Instead, we'll need to do some "vector" math, which is made easy by the methods inside the <b>PVector</b> class.<br />
<br />
The methods for this class are extensive. For a complete list, visit the <a href="http://processing.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/processing/build/javadoc/core/">developer's reference.</a>
