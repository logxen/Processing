<description><![CDATA[
Reads the contents of a file or url and creates a String array of its individual lines. If a file is specified, it must be located in the sketch's "data" directory/folder.<br /> 
<br />
The filename parameter can also be a URL to a file found online. For security reasons, a Processing sketch found online can only download files from the same server from which it came. Getting around this restriction requires a <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/Sign_an_Applet">signed applet</a>.
<br />
If the file is not available or an error occurs, <b>null</b> will be returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt the program, however the null value may cause a NullPointerException if your code does not check whether the value returned is null.
<br/> <br/>
Starting with Processing release 0134, all files loaded and saved by the Processing API use UTF-8 encoding. In previous releases, the default encoding for your platform was used, which causes problems when files are moved to other platforms.
