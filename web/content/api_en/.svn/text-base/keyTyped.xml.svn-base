<description><![CDATA[
The <b>keyTyped()</b> function is called once every time a key is pressed, but action keys such as Ctrl, Shift, and Alt are ignored. Because of how operating systems handle key repeats, holding down a key will cause multiple calls to <b>keyTyped()</b>, the rate is set by the operating system and how each computer is configured.
