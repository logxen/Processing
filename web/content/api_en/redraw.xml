<description><![CDATA[
Executes the code within <b>draw()</b> one time. This functions allows the program to update the display window only when necessary, for example when an event registered by <b>mousePressed()</b> or <b>keyPressed()</b> occurs. 
<br/><br/>
In structuring a program, it only makes sense to call redraw() within events such as <b>mousePressed()</b>. This is because <b>redraw()</b> does not run <b>draw()</b> immediately (it only sets a flag that indicates an update is needed). 
<br/><br/>
Calling <b>redraw()</b> within <b>draw()</b> has no effect because <b>draw()</b> is continuously called anyway.
