<description><![CDATA[
Creates a new file in the sketch folder, and a <b>PrintWriter</b> object to write to it. For the file to be made correctly, it should be flushed and must be closed with its <b>flush()</b> and <b>close()</b> methods (see above example).

Starting with Processing release 0134, all files loaded and saved by the Processing API use UTF-8 encoding. In previous releases, the default encoding for your platform was used, which causes problems when files are moved to other platforms.
