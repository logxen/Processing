  <p>
    The DXF library writes all triangle-based graphics (polygons, boxes, spheres, etc.) to a DXF file. 
    It works with the <strong>beginRaw()</strong> and <strong>endRaw()</strong> functions. 
	These functions will grab and save the shape data just before it is rendered to the screen. 
	At this stage, your entire scene is nothing but a long list of lines and triangles. 
	This means that a shape created with the <strong>sphere()</strong> function will be made up of 
	hundreds of triangles, rather than a single object.<br />
	<br />
    Use an event function like a <strong>keyPressed()</strong> to trigger it, to avoid writing a 
    file each time through <strong>draw()</strong>. By default, the file will be saved to the 
    sketch's folder. Use Sketch &gt; Show Sketch Folder to see it from the Processing Environment.
  </p>
    
  <p>This simple example shows how to use the library: </p>

  <pre>import processing.dxf.*;

boolean record;

void setup() {
  size(500, 500, P3D);
}

void draw() {
  if (record) {
    beginRaw(DXF, "output.dxf");
  }

  // Do all your drawing here
  if (record) {
    endRaw();
    record = false;
  }
}

void keyPressed() {
  // Use a key press so that it doesn't make a million files
  if (key == 'r') {
  	record = true;
  }
}
</pre>

</div>
