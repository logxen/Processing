Processing has built-in functions that make it easy for you
to have objects in a sketch move, spin, and grow
or shrink. This tutorial will introduce you to the 
<code>translate</code>, <code>rotate</code>, and
<code>scale</code> functions so that you can use them
in your sketches.
</p>

<h3>Translation: Moving the Grid</h3>

<p>
As you know, your Processing window works like a piece of graph paper. When you
want to draw something, you specify its coordinates on the graph.
Here is a simple rectangle drawn with the code
<code>rect(20,&nbsp;20,&nbsp;40,&nbsp;40)</code>. The coordinate
system (a fancy word for &ldquo;graph paper&rdquo;) is shown in gray.
</p>

<p><img src="imgs/original.png" alt="Black rectangle on gray numbered grid"
    width="230" height="230" /></p>

<p>
If you want to move the rectangle 60 units right and 80 units down,
you can just change the coordinates by adding to the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
starting point:
<code>rect(20&nbsp;+&nbsp;60,&nbsp;20&nbsp;+&nbsp;80,&nbsp;40,&nbsp;40)</code> and the rectangle will appear
in a different place. (We put the arrow in there for dramatic effect.)
</p>

<p><img src="imgs/new_coords.png" alt="Black rectangle on gray numbered grid, moved"
    width="230" height="230" /></p>

<p>
But there is a more interesting way to do it: <strong>move the graph paper instead</strong>.
If you move the graph paper 60 units right and 80 units down,
you will get exactly the same visual result. Moving
the coordinate system is called <dfn>translation</dfn>.
</p>

<p><img src="imgs/moved_grid.png" alt="grid moved with arrow showing motion"
    width="240" height="240" /></p>

<p>
The important thing to notice in the preceding diagram is that, as far as
the rectangle is concerned, it hasn&rsquo;t moved at all. Its upper left
corner is still at (20,20). When you use transformations, the things you
draw <em>never</em> change position; the coordinate system does.
</p>

<p>
Here is code that draws the rectangle in red by changing its coordinates,
then draws it in blue by moving the grid. The rectangles are translucent
so that you can see that they are (visually) at the same place. Only the method used to
move them has changed. Copy and paste this code into Processing and give it a try.
</p>

<pre>
void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
  background(255);
  noStroke();

  // draw the original position in gray
  fill(192);
  rect(20, 20, 40, 40);
  
  // draw a translucent red rectangle by changing the coordinates
  fill(255, 0, 0, 128);
  rect(20 + 60, 20 + 80, 40, 40);
  
  // draw a translucent blue rectangle by translating the grid
  fill(0, 0, 255, 128);
  pushMatrix();
  translate(60, 80);
  rect(20, 20, 40, 40);
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s look at the translation code in more detail.
<code>pushMatrix()</code> is a built-in function that
saves the current position of the coordinate system. The 
<code>translate(60,&nbsp;80)</code> moves the coordinate system 60 units right
and 80 units down. The <code>rect(20,&nbsp;20,&nbsp;40,&nbsp;40)</code> draws the
rectangle at the same place it was originally. Remember, the things you draw
don&rsquo;t move&mdash;the grid moves instead. Finally,
<code>popMatrix()</code> restores the coordinate system to the way it was
before you did the translate.
</p>

<p>
Yes, you could have done a <code>translate(-60,&nbsp;-80)</code> to
move the grid back to its original position. However, when you start
doing more sophisticated operations with the coordinate system, it&rsquo;s
easier to use <code>pushMatrix()</code> and <code>popMatrix()</code> to
save and restore the status rather than having to undo all your operations.
Later on in this tutorial, you will find out why those functions
seem to have such strange names.
</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s the Advantage?</h3>
<p>
You may be thinking that picking up the coordinate system and moving it
is a lot more trouble than just adding to coordinates. For a simple example
like the rectangle, you are correct. But let&rsquo;s take an example of
where <code>translate()</code> can make life easier. Here is some
code that draws a row of houses. It uses a loop that calls
function named <code>house()</code>, which takes
the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> location of the 
house&rsquo;s upper-left corner as its parameters.</p>

<p><img src="imgs/houses.png" alt="Row of stick-figure houses"
    width="358" height="81" /></p>

<pre>
void setup()
{
  size(400, 100);
  background(255);
  for (int i = 10; i &lt; 350; i = i + 50)
  {
    house(i, 20);
  }
}

</pre>

<p>
This is the code for drawing the house by changing its
position. Look at all the additions that you
have to keep track of.
</p>

<pre>
void house(int x, int y)
{
  triangle(x + 15, y, x, y + 15, x + 30, y + 15);
  rect(x, y + 15, 30, 30);
  rect(x + 12, y + 30, 10, 15);
}

</pre>

<p>
Compare that to the version of the function that uses <code>translate()</code>.
In this case, the code draws the house in the same place every time,
with its upper left corner at (0,&nbsp;0), and lets translation do all the
work instead.
</p>

<pre>
void house(int x, int y)
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(x, y);
  triangle(15, 0, 0, 15, 30, 15);
  rect(0, 15, 30, 30);
  rect(12, 30, 10, 15);
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>


<h3>Rotation</h3>
<p>
In addition to moving the grid, you can also rotate it with the
<code>rotate()</code> function. This function takes one argument, which is
the number of <i>radians</i> that you want to rotate. In Processing, all
the functions that have to do with rotation measure angles in radians rather
than degrees.  When you talk about angles in degrees, you say that a full circle
has 360&#xb0;. When you talk about angles in radians, you say that a full circle has
2&pi; radians. Here is a diagram of how Processing measures angles in degrees (black)
and radians (red).
</p>

<p><img src="imgs/degrees.png" alt="Degrees are measured clockwise with zero being at 3 o'clock"
    width="158" height="158" /></p>

<p>
Since most people think in degrees, Processing has a built-in <code>radians()</code> function
which takes a number of degrees as its argument and converts it for you.  It also has
a <code>degrees()</code> function that converts radians to degrees. Given that background,
let&rsquo;s try rotating a square clockwise 45 degrees.
</p>

<img src="imgs/bad_rotate.png" alt="square has moved and rotated"
    width="120" height="120" style="float: right;" />
<pre>
void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
  background(255);
  smooth();
  fill(192);
  noStroke();
  rect(40, 40, 40, 40);
  
  pushMatrix();
  rotate(radians(45));
  fill(0);
  rect(40, 40, 40, 40);
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<p>Hey, what happened? How come the square got moved and cut off?
The answer is: the square did not move. The <strong>grid</strong> was rotated.
Here is what really happened. As you can see, on the rotated coordinate system,
the square still has its upper left corner at (40,&nbsp;40).
</p>

<p><img src="imgs/rotated_grid.png" alt="shows grid rotated 45 degrees clockwise"
    width="275" height="250" /></p>

<h3>Rotating the Correct Way</h3>
<p>
The correct way to rotate the square is to:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>Translate the coordinate
system&rsquo;s origin (0,&nbsp;0) to where you want
the upper left of the square to be.</li>
<li>Rotate the grid &pi;/4 radians (45&#xb0;)</li>
<li>Draw the square at the origin.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="imgs/correct_rotate_grid.png" width="310" height="250"
    alt="Grid translated, then rotated" /></p>

<p>
And here is the code and its result, without the grid marks.
</p>

<img src="imgs/good_rotate.png" width="120" height="120"
    alt="result of properly rotating square"
    style="float: right;" />
<pre>
void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
  background(255);
  smooth();
  fill(192);
  noStroke();
  rect(40, 40, 40, 40);
  
  pushMatrix();
  // move the origin to the pivot point
  translate(40, 40); 
  
  // then pivot the grid
  rotate(radians(45));
  
  // and draw the square at the origin
  fill(0);
  rect(0, 0, 40, 40);
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<p>
And here is a program that generates a wheel of colors by using
rotation. The screenshot is reduced to save space.
</p>


<img src="imgs/wheel.png" width="87" height="86"
    alt="multiply rotated rectangle in different colors"
    style="float: right;" />
<pre>
void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  background(255);
  smooth();
  noStroke();
}

void draw(){
  if (frameCount % 10 == 0) {
    fill(frameCount * 3 % 255, frameCount * 5 % 255,
      frameCount * 7 % 255);
    pushMatrix();
    translate(100, 100);
    rotate(radians(frameCount * 2  % 360));
    rect(0, 0, 80, 20);
    popMatrix();
  }
}
</pre>

<h3>Scaling</h3>
<p>
The final coordinate system transformation is
scaling, which changes the size of the grid. Take a look at this example,
which draws a square, then scales the grid to twice its normal size,
and draws it again.
</p>

<img src="imgs/scale1.png" width="145" height="145"
    alt="gray square scaled up to double size"
    style="float: right;" />
<pre>
void setup()
{
  size(200,200);
  background(255);
  
  stroke(128);
  rect(20, 20, 40, 40);
  
  stroke(0);
  pushMatrix();
  scale(2.0);
  rect(20, 20, 40, 40);
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<p>
First, you can see that the square appears to have moved. It hasn&rsquo;t, of
course. Its upper left corner is still at (20,&nbsp;20) on the
scaled-up grid, but that point is
now twice as far away from the origin as it was in the original coordinate
system. You can also see that the lines are thicker. That&rsquo;s no optical
illusion&mdash;the lines really are twice as thick, because the coordinate system
has been scaled to double its size.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Programming Challenge:</strong> Scale up the black square, but keep its
upper left corner in the same place as the gray square. Hint: use 
<code>translate()</code> to move the origin, then use <code>scale()</code>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is no law saying that you have to scale the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> dimensions
equally. Try using <code>scale(3.0,&nbsp;0.5)</code> to make the <i>x</i> dimension
three times its normal size and the <i>y</i> dimension only half its normal size.
</p>

<h3>Order Matters</h3>
<p>
When you do multiple transformations, the order makes a difference. A rotation
followed by a translate followed by a scale will not give the same results as a
translate followed by a rotate by a scale. Here is some sample code and
the results.
</p>

<img src="imgs/order.png" width="144" height="168"
    alt="result of different orders of rotate/translate/scale" 
    style="float: right;"/>
<pre>
void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
  background(255);
  smooth();
  line(0, 0, 200, 0); // draw axes
  line(0, 0, 0, 200);
  
  pushMatrix();
  fill(255, 0, 0); // red square
  rotate(radians(30));
  translate(70, 70);
  scale(2.0);
  rect(0, 0, 20, 20);
  popMatrix();

  pushMatrix();
  fill(255); // white square
  translate(70, 70);
  rotate(radians(30));
  scale(2.0);
  rect(0, 0, 20, 20);
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<h3>The Transformation Matrix</h3>
<p>
Every time you do a rotation, translation, or scaling, the information
required to do the transformation is accumulated into a table of
numbers. This table, or <dfn>matrix</dfn> has only a few rows
and columns, yet, through the miracle of mathematics, it contains all the
information needed to do any series of transformations. And that&rsquo;s
why the <code>pushMatrix()</code> and <code>popMatrix()</code> have that
word in their name.
</p>

<h3>Push and Pop</h3>
<p>
What, about the <i>push</i> and <i>pop</i> part of the names? These come from a computer
concept known as a <dfn>stack</dfn>, which works like a spring-loaded tray
dispenser in a cafeteria. 
When someone returns a tray to the stack, its weight pushes the platform down.
When someone needs a tray, he takes it from the top of the stack,
and the remaining trays pop up a little bit.
</p>

<p>In a similar manner, <code>pushMatrix()</code> puts the current status of
the coordinate system at the top of a memory area, and <code>popMatrix()</code>
pulls that status back out. The preceding example used
<code>pushMatrix()</code> and <code>popMatrix()</code> to make sure that the
coordinate system was &ldquo;clean&rdquo; before each part of the drawing.
In all of the other examples, the calls to those two functions weren&rsquo;t
really necessary, but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt anything to save and restore
the grid status.
</p>

<p>
Note: in Processing, the coordinate system is restored to its original state
(origin at the upper left of the window, no rotation, and no scaling) every
time that the <code>draw()</code> function is executed.
</p>

<h3>Three-dimensional Transforms</h3>
<p>
If you are working in three dimensions, you can call the
<code>translate()</code> function with three arguments for the
<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> distances. Similarly, you can
call <code>scale()</code> with three arguments that tell how
much you want the grid scaled in each of those dimensions.
</p>

<p>
For rotation, call the <code>rotateX()</code>, 
<code>rotateY()</code>, or <code>rotateZ()</code> function
to rotate around each of the axes. All three of these functions
expect one argument: the number of radians to rotate.
</p>

<h3>Case Study: An Arm-Waving Robot</h3>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s use these transformations to animate a blue
robot waving its arms. Rather than try to write it all at
once, we will do the work in stages. The first step is
to draw the robot without any animation.
</p>

<p>
The robot is modeled on
<a href="http://www.openclipart.org/detail/5457">this
drawing</a>, although it will not look as charming.
First, we draw the robot so that its
left and top side touch the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes. That
will allow us to use <code>translate()</code> to easily place
the robot anywhere we want or to make multiple copies of
the robot, as we did in the example of the houses.
</p>

<p>
When we refer to left and right in this drawing, we mean your
left and right (the left and right side of your monitor),
not the robot&rsquo;s left and right.
</p>


<img src="imgs/whole_robot.png" width="84"
    height="136" alt="blue robot, arms at sides"
    style="float: right;" />
<pre>
void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
  background(255);
  smooth();
  drawRobot();
}

void drawRobot()
{
  noStroke();
  fill(38, 38, 200);
  rect(20, 0, 38, 30); // head
  rect(14, 32, 50, 50); // body

  rect(0, 32, 12, 37); // left arm
  rect(66, 32, 12, 37); // right arm
  
  rect(22, 84, 16, 50); // left leg
  rect(40, 84, 16, 50); // right leg
  
  fill(222, 222, 249);
  ellipse(30, 12, 12, 12); // left eye
  ellipse(47, 12, 12, 12); // right eye
}

</pre>


<p>
<img src="imgs/pivot.png" width="82" height="52"
    style="float: right;" alt="robot with red dots at shoulder joints" />
The next step is to identify the points where
the arms pivot. That is shown in this drawing.
The pivot points are (12,&nbsp;32) and
(66,&nbsp;32). Note: the term &ldquo;center of rotation&rdquo;
is a more formal term for the pivot point.
</p>

<p>
Now, separate the code for drawing the left and right
arms, and move the center of rotation for each arm to the origin, because
you always rotate around the (0,&nbsp;0) point. To save space,
we are not repeating the code for <code>setup()</code>.
</p>

<pre>
void drawRobot()
{
  noStroke();
  fill(38, 38, 200);
  rect(20, 0, 38, 30); // head
  rect(14, 32, 50, 50); // body
  drawLeftArm();
  drawRightArm();
  rect(22, 84, 16, 50); // left leg
  rect(40, 84, 16, 50); // right leg
  
  fill(222, 222, 249);
  ellipse(30, 12, 12, 12); // left eye
  ellipse(47, 12, 12, 12);  // right eye
}

void drawLeftArm()
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(12, 32);
  rect(-12, 0, 12, 37);
  popMatrix();
}

void drawRightArm()
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(66, 32);
  rect(0, 0, 12, 37);
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<p>
Now test to see if the arms rotate properly.
Rather than attempt a full animation, we will just
rotate the left side arm 135 degrees
and the right side arm -45 degrees as a test. Here
is the code that needs to be added, and the result.
The left side arm is cut off because of the window
boundaries, but we&rsquo;ll fix that in the final
animation.
</p>

<img src="imgs/rotate_test.png" alt="robot with arms at angle"
    width="109" height="72" style="float: right;" />
<pre>
void drawLeftArm()
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(12, 32);
  <b>rotate(radians(135));</b>
  rect(-12, 0, 12, 37); // left arm
  popMatrix();
}

void drawRightArm()
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(66, 32);
  <b>rotate(radians(-45));</b>
  rect(0, 0, 12, 37); // right arm
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<p>
Now we complete the program by putting in the animation. The
left arm has to rotate from 0&deg; to 135&deg; and back.
Since the arm-waving is symmetric, the
right-arm angle will always be the negative value of
the left-arm angle. To make things simple,
we will go in increments of 5
degrees. 
</p>

<pre>
int armAngle = 0;
int angleChange = 5;
final int ANGLE_LIMIT = 135;

void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
  smooth();
  frameRate(30);
}

void draw()
{
  background(255);
  pushMatrix();
  translate(50, 50); // place robot so arms are always on screen
  drawRobot();
  armAngle += angleChange;
  
  // if the arm has moved past its limit,
  // reverse direction and set within limits.
  if (armAngle > ANGLE_LIMIT || armAngle &lt; 0)
  {
    angleChange = -angleChange;
    armAngle += angleChange;
  }
  popMatrix();
}

void drawRobot()
{
  noStroke();
  fill(38, 38, 200);
  rect(20, 0, 38, 30); // head
  rect(14, 32, 50, 50); // body
  drawLeftArm();
  drawRightArm();
  rect(22, 84, 16, 50); // left leg
  rect(40, 84, 16, 50); // right leg
  
  fill(222, 222, 249);
  ellipse(30, 12, 12, 12); // left eye
  ellipse(47, 12, 12, 12);  // right eye
}

void drawLeftArm()
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(12, 32);
  rotate(radians(armAngle));
  rect(-12, 0, 12, 37); // left arm
  popMatrix();
}

void drawRightArm()
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(66, 32);
  rotate(radians(-armAngle));
  rect(0, 0, 12, 37); // right arm
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<h3>Case Study: Interactive Rotation</h3>
<p>
Instead of having the arms move on their own, we will modify the program
so that the arms follow the mouse while the mouse button is pressed. Instead
of just writing the program at the keyboard, we first think about the
problem and figure out what the program needs to do. 
</p>

<p>Since the two arms move independently of
one another, we need to have one variable for each arm&rsquo;s angle.
It&rsquo;s easy to figure out which arm to track. If the mouse is at the
left side of the robot&rsquo;s center, track the left arm; otherwise,
track the right arm.
</p>

<p>
The remaining problem is to figure out the angle of rotation. Given the
pivot point position and the mouse position, how do you determine the
angle of a line connecting those two points?  The answer comes from the
<code>atan2()</code> function, which gives (in radians) the angle
of a line from the origin to a given <i>y</i> and <i>x</i> coordinate.
In constrast to most other functions, the <i>y</i> coordinate comes
first. <code>atan2()</code> returns a value from -&pi; to &pi; radians,
which is the equivalent of -180&deg; to 180&deg;.
</p>

<p>
But what about finding the angle of a line that doesn&rsquo;t start
from the origin, such as the line from (10,&nbsp;37) to (48,&nbsp;59)?
No problem; it&rsquo;s the same as the angle of a line from
(0,&nbsp;0) to (48-10,&nbsp;59-37). In general, to find the
angle of the line from (<i>x</i><sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;<i>y</i><sub>0</sub>)
to (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<i>y</i><sub>1</sub>), calculate
</p>

<pre>
   atan2(<i>y</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>y</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>)

</pre>

<p>
Because this is a new concept, rather than integrate it into the robot
program, you should write a 
simple test program to see that you understand how <code>atan2()</code>
works. This program draws a rectangle whose center of rotation is
its upper left corner at (100,&nbsp;100) and tracks the mouse.
</p>

<pre>
void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
}

void draw()
{
  float angle = atan2(mouseY - 100, mouseX - 100);
  
  background(255);
  pushMatrix();
  translate(100, 100);
  rotate(angle);
  rect(0, 0, 50, 10);
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<p>
That works great. What happens if we draw the rectangle so it is
taller than it is wide? Change the preceding code to read
<code>rect(0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;50)</code>. How come it
doesn&rsquo;t seem to follow the mouse any more? The answer is
that the rectangle really <em>is</em> still following the mouse,
but it&rsquo;s the short side of the rectangle that does the following.
Our eyes are trained to want the long side to be tracked. Because
the long side is at a 90 degree angle to the short side,
you have to subtract 90&deg; (or &pi;/2 radians) to get the
desired effect. Change the preceding code to read
<code>rotate(angle&nbsp;-&nbsp;HALF_PI)</code> and try it again.
Since Processing deals almost exclusively in radians,
the language has defined the constants <code>PI</code> (180&deg;),
<code>HALF_PI</code> (90&deg;), <code>QUARTER_PI</code> (45&deg;)
and <code>TWO_PI</code> (360&deg;) for your convenience.
</p>

<p>
At this point, we can write the final version of the
arm-tracking program. We start off with definitions
of constants and variables. The number 39
in the definition of <code>MIDPOINT_X</code>
comes from the fact that the body of the robot starts at
<i>x</i>-coordinate 14 and is 50 pixels wide, so 39 (14&nbsp;+&nbsp;25)
is the horizontal midpoint of the robot&rsquo;s body.
</p>

<pre>
/* Where upper left of robot appears on screen */
final int ROBOT_X = 50;

<p>
The <code>draw()</code> function is next. It determines if the
mouse is pressed and the angle between the mouse location
and the pivot point, setting <code>leftArmAngle</code> and
<code>rightArmAngle</code> accordingly.
</p>

<pre>
void draw()
{
  /*
   * These variables are for mouseX and mouseY,
   * adjusted to be relative to the robot's coordinate system
   * instead of the window's coordinate system.
   */
  float mX;
  float mY;
  
  background(255);
  pushMatrix();
  translate(ROBOT_X, ROBOT_Y); // place robot so arms are always on screen
  if (mousePressed)
  {
    mX = mouseX - ROBOT_X;
    mY = mouseY - ROBOT_Y;
    if (mX &lt; MIDPOINT_X) // left side of robot
    {
      leftArmAngle = atan2(mY - PIVOT_Y, mX - LEFT_PIVOT_X)
      - HALF_PI;
    }
    else
    {
      rightArmAngle = atan2(mY - PIVOT_Y, mX - RIGHT_PIVOT_X)
      - HALF_PI;
   }
  }
  drawRobot();
  
  popMatrix();
}

</pre>

<p>
The <code>drawRobot()</code> function remains unchanged, but a
minor change to <code>drawLeftArm()</code> and <code>drawRightArm()</code>
is now necessary. Because <code>leftArmAngle</code> and
<code>rightArmAngle</code> are now computed in radians, the
functions don&rsquo;t have to do any conversion. The changes
to the two functions are in bold.
</p>

<pre>
void drawLeftArm()
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(12, 32);
  <b>rotate(leftArmAngle);</b>
  rect(-12, 0, 12, 37); // left arm
  popMatrix();
}

void drawRightArm()
{
  pushMatrix();
  translate(66, 32);
  <b>rotate(rightArmAngle);</b>
  rect(0, 0, 12, 37); // right arm
  popMatrix();
}
